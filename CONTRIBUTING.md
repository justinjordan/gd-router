The biggest thing to keep in mind is **SIMPLICITY**. The point of this library is to be easy to use. Try not to add
complexity unless there's no other way. If you have questions, feel free to ask via issues.

## Versioning

* Bump the *PATCH* version if you:
  - Fix a bug
  - Make changes without adding a feature (docs, comments, etc)

* Bump the *MINOR* version if you:
  - Add a feature

* **DON'T** bump the *MAJOR* version!
